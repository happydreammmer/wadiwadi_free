## Reel Video Download Technology

### Advanced Extraction Methods
The extension employs sophisticated techniques to extract reel video URLs:

1. **Multi-URL Strategy**: Attempts original URL, embed version, post format, and API variations
2. **HTML Parsing**: 5 different parsing methods including:
   - `window._sharedData` script extraction
   - `application/json` script tag parsing  
   - General script tag JSON detection
   - Direct .mp4 URL pattern matching

5. **Quality Prioritization**: Prefers Instagram CDN and fbcdn URLs for reliability

### Video URL Properties Detected
- Standard formats: `video_url`, `src`, `url`, `playback_url`
- Instagram-specific: `video_versions`, `dash_manifest`, `additional_candidates`
- Quality variants: `video_url_hd`, `progressive_download_url`, `download_url`
- And 15+ other common video property formats

## Instagram DOM Structure Analysis

The extension uses sophisticated selectors based on Instagram's current DOM structure:

### Profile Data Selectors

- **Following**: Links to `/username/following/` with count spans
- **Bio**: Profile description sections with `dir="auto"` attributes
- **Profile Picture**: `img` elements with profile picture alt text

### Media Elements
- **Post Images**: `img` elements within post containers with high-resolution URLs
